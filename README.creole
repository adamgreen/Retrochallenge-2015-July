Today is the start of the
[[http://www.wickensonline.co.uk/retrochallenge-2012sc/rc201507-entrants-list/ | 2015/07 Retrochallenge]].  I am now
listed in the official entrant list so I guess it is time for me to start reading some CoCo related literature.  I think
I am going to start with
[[http://www.amazon.com/CoCo-Colorful-History-Underdog-Computer/dp/1466592478/ | "CoCo: The Colorful History of Tandy's Underdog Computer" by Boisy G Pitre & Bill Loguidice]].
This will be the appetizer before I dig into the more technical entrees.



==June 29th, 2015 - Project Overview
It has been awhile since my last [[https://github.com/adamgreen/Retrochallenge-2014WW#readme | Retrochallenge]] and I
think it is high time that I do something retrocomputer related again.

I am currently busy with other hobby projects this year but I would still like to take some time to start getting
back up to speed on the computer which started it all for me back in 1983, the TRS-80 Color Computer 2.  With this goal
in mind I think I want to start (re)reading some of the CoCo books that I already own with the intention of:
* Learning 6809 assembly language
* Learning how to utilize CoCo2 specific features (graphics, sound, etc) from 6809 assembly language code
* Dreaming up potential CoCo2 game projects for future Retrochallenge projects
* Dreaming up potential CoCo2 hardware projects for future Retrochallenge projects

My reading will draw from this existing selection of books that I already own:\\
